# ARM Discourse LDAP Plugin

This plugin was forked from the original discourse-ldap-auth plugin in order to customize
the login page.  Note that the html for the login page is part of the omniauth gem,
so we can't customize it easily.  So for now we are providing login page customizations
via css styles only.
